# Overall Goal: write a code that returns a string with 
# a phrase where every word is capitalized

# start with a string that contains a sentence.
# Make sure that every word in the string is lowercase.

# look at each element with the .each method and 
# check to see if the first letter of each word is 
# lowercase
# use a method that capitalizes the first character of
# every word
# it will print each word starting with an uppercase 
# letter

# activities = ["running", "soccer", "golf", "rowing"]

# activities.each do |activity|
#     p activity.capitalize!
# end

# phrase = "this is so fun!"


# def capitalize_first
#      .map(&:capitalize)
#     end
# end

phrase = "this is so fun!"

phrase.split

p.phrase.capitalize_first

# def capitalize_first(string)
#     string.each 

# p phrase.titleize("this is so fun!")

# phrase = "this is so fun!"

# p phrase.split

# p phrase.first.upcase!

# p phrase
